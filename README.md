# Julianas-Grade-Calculator-for-Hadavass-Calculus-I-Fall-2023-Class

Allows you take the grades you earned in his class (tests, final, attendance), enter them in the program, and the program will give you your overall grade.

The program will also determine what scheme will be used and what test will be dropped as as result of using scheme 2.

The program will also tell you what your midterm grade is (soon to change to what your grade in the class is as of test 3).

Version 3.0 will be released Wednesday, October 25th, 2023 that will feature the change above, valid grade checking, an area to save your grades so you don't have to remember them or put them in to calculate your overall grade, an algorithm to calculate what grade you need on the final after all tests and attendance points accounted for, and overall polishing and cleaner code.
