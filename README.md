# Julianas-Grade-Calculator-for-Hadavass-Calculus-I-Fall-2023-Class

Allows you take the grades you earned in his class (tests, final, attendance), enter them in the program, and the program will give you your overall grade.

The program will also determine what scheme will be used and what test will be dropped as as result of using scheme 2.

The program will also tell you your overall grade as of test 4, excluding any schemes or attendance points.**

The program also tells you what letter grade you get if you pass the class.

The program will also tell you what grade you need to earn a D*, C, B, or A average overall in the class, and if you can earn a 100% perfect overall score in the class.

You can also save your grades in a file for future calculations so you won't have to type them in or remember them!***

You can run the program in an IDE, a command line interface, (or an offical shortcut that you can click to run it like a regular program, but runs in a command line. (Windows/Mac Only))*

DISCLAIMER: There may be a slight margin of error of about 0.01, but that means it should have minimum impact. 
DISCLAIMER: The grade calculator only takes grades between 0 - 100.0 and attendance points between 0 - 12, if you were issued a grade that was outside the range for whatever reason, leave it in the issues section and I will address it. 
DISCLAIMER: 100% is the hard limit of the final grade, even if you really earned 102% or 101%, to be more respective of the college grading system.

Report any issues to the issues tab if needed!
